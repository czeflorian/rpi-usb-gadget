# rpi-usb-gadget

Setup scripts for running Raspberry Pi (or any other debian-based distros) as USB gadget on a host computer, keeping the Wi-Fi connection free for other stuff.

I created this because I needed an SSH connection to my Raspberry Pi 4B, while keeping the Wi-Fi interface(s) free for other connections.
The scripts are meant to be used with a Raspberry Pi, but will also work with any other Debian based systems, as they are using standard debian tooling.

<strong>This needs to run as root!</strong>
